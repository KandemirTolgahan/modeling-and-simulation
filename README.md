## Robot:
In this project we consider a very simplified model, in which the robot consists of two arms that move in one plane. Swivel joints allow the rotation of the arms. The arms have a fixed length. At the end of the second arm, an object hangs vertically downwards, attached to a freely suspended rope.
## TSP:
Simulation of the traveling salesman problem with various algoorithms like the brute-force-, greedy-, 2-opt- and simulated-annealing-algorithm
## Quarter-Car:
In this project a very simplified model is considered, where the vehicle consists of only one mass point, which is connected to a wheel via a spring-damper system. In vehicle dynamics, this simplified model is called a quarter car suspension. The aim is to simulate and visualize the vibration behavior of the spring-damper system. Virtual test tracks with different road profiles are analysed.
## Water-Waves:
The simulation of waves in water is the subject of many current research projects. We are looking at a very simplified model in which the propagation of waves in a rectangular water basin is to be simulated.
## Fountain:
In this project we consider a simple example where water flows from a cylindrical bottle through a sloped outlet tube into a collecting basin
